# autonomous-driving-vision-suite
This project aims to develop an integrated vision-based autonomous driving system using state-of-the-art models for real-time segmentation, object detection, object tracking, and lane detection. The system combines various models to detect and track objects, segment road elements, and identify lanes to make informed driving decisions.
